About Me
My name is Darren Cedrone. I am currently enrolled in Stack Education's coding bootcamp. I am excited to change to a more relevant career field and to continue to grow as a person.

For Fun
My biggest hobby is music. I play guitar, bass, and I sing. I also write original songs and record them in my free time. As far as listening goes, I love all types of genres, but am constantly rotating my music. I am always willing to talk about favorite artists/bands and upcoming concerts. For non-musical hobbies, I like soccer and working out. I also play video games, though I am focusing less on them as they are a distraction from schoolwork. Maybe I can create a video game some day AND make the soundtrack for it.

Technical Skills
Reaper, Microsoft Word, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premier, evidently not Command Line since I can't actually figure out how to make new lines in this text file (though I remedied this with GitHub's text editor. Thanks GitHub!)
